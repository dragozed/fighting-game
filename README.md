# Fighting Game

This project is created by [me](https://github.com/dragozed) to develop a better understanding of React and TypeScript.

## What is Fighting Game?

Fighting game is a roguelike game where the player tries to defeat stages using his/her character and minion. When your character dies the run is over and you need to start from stage1. Defeating stages rewards with materials. Players can use the materials to improve the village and get stronger to push later stages.

## Backend

You can find backend repo for this project [here](https://github.com/dragozed/fighting-game-backend).
I am using free heroku on backend so it runs out of free trial hours close to end of the month.
